# To-Do App

A minimal to-do app built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Add tasks, mark them complete, and delete them. Your list is saved in the browser (localStorage) and persists across reloads.

## How to run

Open `index.html` in a browser (double-click the file or use File → Open). No server required.

Optionally, use a simple local server:

```bash
# Python 3
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Then open http://localhost:8000
```
