# Project standards

- **Branch and commit:** Use consistent branch names (e.g. feature/, fix/, chore/) and conventional commit messages (e.g. feat:, fix:, docs:). No force-push to shared branches.
- **ADRs:** Write Architecture Decision Records for significant technical decisions. Store in `docs/adr/` or a documented path. Include context, decision, and consequences.
- **DDD:** Use bounded context names in folder and module structure. Align code organisation with domain boundaries and ubiquitous language.
- **ACI:** Treat Availability, Confidentiality, and Integrity as non-negotiable design constraints. Design and code must support them.
- **Three paths:** Design and implement **happy path**, **exception path**, and **error path**—not only the happy path. See typescript-node, express-api, resilience-recovery, observability, and testing rules.
- **Inclusive language:** Use inclusive, neutral terminology in code, docs, and commit messages (e.g. allowlist/denylist, primary/replica). Avoid terms that exclude or offend.
- **Fitness tests:** Before merge, ensure changes satisfy fitness function tests. See the fitness-functions rule.
