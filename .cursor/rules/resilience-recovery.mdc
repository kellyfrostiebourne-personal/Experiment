# Resilience and recovery

- **Fault tolerance:** Design for failure. Graceful degradation: when a dependency fails, degrade functionality instead of failing entirely where possible.
- **Idempotency:** APIs and background jobs that modify state should be idempotent where possible (same request/event applied twice = same result). Use idempotency keys for critical operations.
- **Circuit breakers / bulkheads:** For external calls (APIs, DB, queues), consider circuit breakers or bulkheads to isolate failures and avoid cascades.
- **Error path:** Explicitly handle the error path: unexpected failures, timeouts, downstream errors. Fail safely and consistently; return 5xx or equivalent with safe messages; log for debugging. Do not leak internals.
- **Backup and restore:** Define backup/restore for persistent data. Document RTO/RPO where defined. Test restore periodically.
