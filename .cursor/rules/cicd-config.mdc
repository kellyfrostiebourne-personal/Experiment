# CI/CD and configuration

- **Automated builds and deployments:** Use CI to build, test, and deploy. Builds and deployments should be repeatable and triggered from version control. Avoid manual-only deploys for production.
- **Env-specific config:** Use environment variables or env-specific config files for per-environment settings. No secrets in repo; inject at deploy or runtime.
- **Feature flags:** Use feature flags for gradual rollout or kill switches where useful. Document how flags are managed and who can change them.
