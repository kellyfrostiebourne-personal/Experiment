# Monitoring and runbooks

- **Health checks:** Expose liveness and readiness endpoints (e.g. `/health`, `/ready`). Liveness = process up; readiness = can serve traffic (DB, dependencies OK). Use in orchestrators and load balancers.
- **SLOs:** Define and track SLOs (e.g. availability, latency p95). Instrument and alert when SLOs are at risk.
- **Alerting:** Alerts should be actionable. Avoid alert fatigue. Route to the right team or runbook.
- **Runbooks/playbooks:** Document how to respond to incidents and common operations (e.g. deploy, rollback, scale). Keep runbooks next to alerts or in `docs/runbooks/`.
