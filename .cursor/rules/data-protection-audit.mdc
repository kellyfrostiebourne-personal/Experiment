# Data protection and audit

- **PII and sensitive data:** Minimise collection and storage. Encrypt at rest and in transit where required. Do not log PII or secrets (see observability rule).
- **Retention:** Define and implement retention and deletion for personal and sensitive data. Document in policy or ADR.
- **Auditability:** Record who did what and when for sensitive or regulated operations. Use immutable audit logs where compliance requires it. Include correlation/request IDs for traceability.
- **GDPR/compliance:** Where applicable, support data subject rights (access, rectification, erasure, portability), lawful basis, and consent. Document compliance approach.
