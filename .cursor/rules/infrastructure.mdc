# Infrastructure

- **IaC:** Use Infrastructure as Code (e.g. Terraform, CloudFormation, Pulumi) for reproducible environments. Version infra definitions in the repo.
- **Change control:** Apply infra changes through the same review process as code (PR, review). Avoid ad-hoc manual changes to production infra.
